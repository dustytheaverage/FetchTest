# FetchTest
This is my attempt at the Fetch Backend Apprentice coding challenge. The challenge was written in Go on Windows 10 using Visual Studio Code as an editor, Git Bash as a terminal, and cURL to test functionality in the terminal. 

Docker was attempted to be used for containering to ensure the functionality on all OSes, but an issue on my end disallowed me from building it. Therefore, the included Dockerfile is an untested file from a developer who is new to using Docker, and most likely nonfunctional.
